            <a href="https://lecourtierduquartier.ca/" target="_blank"><img class="projectimage" src="/img/lcdq-logo.png"></a>
            <p>
              This project started from a spark in the mind of one of my ex co-worker who went from working as an insurance agent to an insurance broker. After seeing the previous
              design of this very website (which I would qualify of shameful but hey, cut me some slack, it was a long time ago), he hit me up with his idea to build a website 
              that would allow users to do quotes online. 
            </p>
            <p>
              That idea is far from new, many have done it and some would say that they did it <i>better</i>. I would disagree and say that we did this <i>differently</i> than 
              other insurance brokers with an online platform. I'm talking about brokers who set all up for minimal effort: log in (or not), fill in a few questions, here is your
              price, give us your credit card info if you're intersted and we'll e-mail you your contract. The whole thing, while certainly being efficient, is cold, detached and most 
              importantly: assumes that users know what questions are asked. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've worked for even a fraction of how long I've worked in insurance (I'm talking about sales, customer service, claims, etc.), you'd know that people have VERY
              little to no idea about how insurance works. The only ones who speak as if they understand what they are talking about are either people who think they know things but 
              are as clueless, if not more, than your average Joe, or people who work or used to work in insurance.  
            </p>
            <p>
              So when you ask "In what year did you get your driving license" (or an equivalent), you'll inevitably get questions like:
            </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Do you mean my learner's license or my <i>real</i> one?</li>
                  <li>I think I had it somewhere between 1990 and 1992, I don't quite remember. What answer should I write on the website?</li>
                  <li>I got it in 1960, but I only was first driver on a vehicle in 2010 when my husband passed. When I did a quote with [<i>insert insurance company here</i>] they 
                    said they needed to know that, is it the same for you?</li>
                  <li>I come from [<i>insert foreign country here</i>], I had my driver's license in that country 20 years ago, I've been driving in Quebec for 3 years now and 
                    got my Quebec's license 2 years ago. What year should I say?</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
              And many, many, many, oh so many more of those.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, if you've done a quote with Le courtier du Quartier, you know it's not like that. Maybe in the future that option will be available, but the goal was to automate
              the tedious part of collecting information. Ask a question, listen to the answer, write down the answer, repeat. Now some have the conversational skills to make the whole
              thing more interesting, but for the most part, it's boring for the broker and the person asking for the quote. With Le courtier du Quartier, you fill out everything on
              your own when you have time for it, you can leave a comment about when you'd like to be called back, at what number, etc. that quote is directly sent to the broker
              who looks at it to make sure everything makes sense, contacts you if there's anything to clarify, that's also where you can ask your questions and change some things, 
              he shops around for you and confirms you the best price possible for the coverage you wanted. 
            </p>
            <p>
              All of the human side of a traditional insurance quote without the boring part (or well you do it on your own). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, that's a business model I can get behind, and the freedom I had in this project was amazing. We met up a couple of times, I'd present different options and solutions 
              and once everything was chosen, I got started. I was the only developper on the project, but the client helped for the design and (obviously) the content. Everything from start 
              to finish: back end, front end, part of the design, hosting, security. For obvious security (and privacy) reasons, I won't get into too much details about how everything works, 
              but I am extremely proud of having managed to get this project to where it is today. This was a great hands-on experience, and it's far from over!
            </p>
            <p>
              We are looking to implement new features, like a customer profile where you can change your info (phone number, address, etc.) and the info is sent to the broker right away!
              Another thing we're looking to add would be "easy quotes" (uh, I like that name), destined for people who tried to fill out the quote but had too many questions for it to 
              be possible and who don't have the time to call and do a quote the <i>normal</i> way. Ideal for people who are looking for their first insurance or the elderly mystified
              by web technologies, this would be a whole project in itself focussed on UX both from a design and insurance perspective.
