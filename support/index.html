              Let's start with the obvious: we all love to eat some good food. There is something very interesting about receiving a variety of new and easy-to-follow recipes every week, 
              delivered right to your doorstep. I don't have a car and not having to do groceries as often as before is such a convenience. Plus, I can say in all honesty that 
              their vegetarian baskets are delicious and very easy to cook with. What really seals the deal is the sheer variety in the recipes. Sure, some of them are kind of alike 
              and will come back, but for the most part, this has made it so much easier for me to not just mix and match in different orders the 7 or 8 recipes that I knew! 
            </p>
            <p>
              If you read this and think to yourself "Yeah, that would be great!", well boy do I have a deal for you: by clicking the goodfood logo above (or by copying and pasting this link 
              in your browser: https://www.makegoodfood.ca/fr/refere-par/l1917659 ), you will be able to receive a 40$ discount on your first basket to see if you like it! Plus, by using that 
              link, not only do you receive this huge discount, but you also help me out! This one is definitely a win-win that you'll love.

              Let's keep going with the good deals! Now, if you know anything about me, you know I love tinkering. But there comes a point when hosting locally all your services off your 
              cheap purchased-used-and-broken and self-refurbished hp ProDesk is no longer enough. Now if you have a maxed-out Dell R710 at home AND you feel confident in your ability to 
              monitor and protect your network, feel free to ignore this part. For the common of mortals, if you want to open your projects to the world, or even just for you, but to be 
              able to access them easily and securely without exposing your network to the world, you'll need a hosting provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are literally so many of those out there, how to choose? Well it depends of course. If all you want is a machine to host a plex server, maybe look towards a provider with unmetered 
              bandwidth or one with a great size/cost ratio. But if you want to host services as websites, CPU intensive applications or anything like that, I believe DigitalOcean and Vultr 
              take the cake. 
            </p>
            <p>
              DigitalOcean is especially interesting for the great quantity of pre-configured VMs. Want to host a Wordpress website? click on the Wordpress "Droplet" (that's what they call 
              their VMs), import your project files and you're done! At the moment of writing this, they have 171 of those "1-Click Applications". If you want to host a "common" service, chances are 
              they have a pre-configured option for you. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also very beginner-friendly with tons of documentation to help you get where you want to be. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The interface is extremely clean, the pricing is fair, performance is great, scalability is easy. If you need a hosting provider, I'd highly consider them.

          <div class="collapsed">
            <p>
              Okay, so the affiliate link right above recommended you use DigitalOcean, so why bother mentioning another hosting provider? 
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything I just said about DigitalOcean is true. It's easy to spin a variety of preconfigured VMs in a matter of seconds, the pricing is incredible, 
              the options for scalability are out of this world AND there is a ton of documentation. 
            </p>
            <p>
              However, despite Vultr not having as many pre-configured VMs, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Let's say the Django VM of DigitalOcean uses Gunicorn, but you planned on using uWSIG instead.
              You'll end up just spinning a vanilla Linux server and install what you need yourself anyway. Or let's say that your Django app is something you'd like to get big, and
              you respected good work ethics and pre-configured a dockerfile for easy installation and horizontal scalability, and all you need is a host that could provide you the
              ability to host it on a kubernetes cluster with a load balancer in front of it. Well as you might imagine, both of those providers can do that! The more
              your skills increase (I'll talk from a web-app development  perspective), the less you'll need all the things DigitalOcean offers. Also, despite Vultr not having as much 
              documentation SPECIFIC to their platform, most documentations for "hosting a django server" or whatever that you find on the DigitalOcean forums can easily be applied to any 
              hosting provider. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, for many users, using one or the other won't be significantly  different. Both offer great performance and great pricing. Both (maybe Vultr a little bit more) 
              are constantly improving their API and it's so easy to use. If I really had to to choose which one has the edge on the other, I would say that DigitalOcean is more beginner-friendly, 
              while Vultr <i>might</i> have the edge for security (they joined the MANRS)
              This honestly might not be a big deal, I frankly don't know, but there is something reassuring about a hosting provider who boasts about their security measures. 
            </p>
            <p>
              From my experience, I've never had any problem with their services. On one server (or Instance), I have a Kubernetes/Docker/Rancher mix which hosts my e-mail server, 
              an instance of code-server and RStudio server (to respectively access an instance of Visual Studio Code and RStudio IDEs in a browser, to do some quick coding on the 
              go from my phone or really any device with internet access) and I even host my own VPN to encrypt data on public networks (as you should always do, but this way 
              is probably one of the cheapest). 
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been impressed by their efficiency when running some intensive calculations. Their money is where their mouth is: their machines have fast SSDs and 
              great CPUs. On top of this, while having great performances and great pricing, they are constantly updating their services to make everything more and more easy and secure.
              If DigitalOcean is not suitable for your need or you want to know what other great providers are out there, Vultr is a favourite of mine.

              Well I guess this one can be short and sweet as I believe most people know what a domain name is for.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, I will add that there is something a bit more professional with having a nicely set-up and secured domain and subdomains, compared to just having a VPN and connecting 
              to [Some IP address]:[Some port] to access your services. 
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why I recommend Epik. There is something about their interface that makes it so simple to do whatever you need to do with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are other options, of course! The close second that comes to mind would be Google Domains, but they're trying to much for my taste to swoop you in their G-Suite,
              which is not something I need as I host my emails and other services myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're looking for a registrar that is simple, let's you do your things, has great prices and doesn't actively push other services from them down your throat, Epik 
              is my recommendation.

              I'm not expecting to receive a fully equipped server, of course. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As of right now, the only thing I self-host is a Nextcloud instance from and old refurbished HP ProDesk 600G1, to which I added an extra M.2 SSD. You'll say that's overkill. You're right. 
              But that's also way underpowered to host a shinyproxy instance by itself (or many other CPU-heavy tasks).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you happen to be looking to throw away old server equipment (how rich are you?) well give me a call. But otherwise, anything can help! The next upgrade I'm looking 
              to make is to add a proper fully pledged firewall. If you happen to have and old computer that has 2 ethernets ports, I'd be ready to buy it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, even though a small computer like the 600G1 might not have the computational power for heavy loads, <i>a cluster would</i>. Many companies replaced old small form 
              computers for laptops after the whole covid situation so people could work from home. Where are those computers now? Low power consumption and of little value for parts. 
              Perfect for me, worthless to you, I'll buy some for cheap!
