              For the common of mortals, if you want to open your projects to the world (or even just for you, but to be 
              able to access them easily and securely without exposing your network to the world), you'll need a hosting provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              DigitalOcean is very beginner-friendly with tons of documentation to help you get where you want to be. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The interface is extremely clean, pricing is fair, performance is great, scalability is easy. If you need a hosting provider, I'd highly consider them.

              Okay, so the affiliate link right above recommended you use DigitalOcean, so why bother mentioning another hosting provider? 
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything I just said about DigitalOcean is true, but if DigitalOcean is not suitable for your need or you want to know what other great providers are out there, Vultr is a favourite of mine.

              Many companies replaced old small form computers for laptops after the whole pandemic situation so people could work from home. Where are those computers now? 
              Low power consumption and of little value for parts. Perfect for me, worthless to you, message me if they're collecting dust!
